Hello Git and GitHub

	This is my first GitHub repository, linked to my local Git repository. Iâ€™ve taken some huge leaps, so be proud! Now I can use your knowledge of Git to track progress on my local computer and push that progress to GitHub whenever I want. I can rest easy knowing that each step of your progress is safely stored in GitHub. <3
